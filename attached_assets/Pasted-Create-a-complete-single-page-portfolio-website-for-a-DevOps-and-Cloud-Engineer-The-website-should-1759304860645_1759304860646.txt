Create a complete, single-page portfolio website for a DevOps and Cloud Engineer. The website should be built using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No external frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind are needed.

The core design theme is "Ancient/Classical". It should look elegant and professional, evoking the feel of old scrolls, stone tablets, and classic architecture.

**File Structure:**
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

**Detailed Instructions:**

**1. General Style (`style.css`):**
   - **Fonts:** Import and use two Google Fonts:
     - 'Cinzel' for all headings (h1, h2, h3).
     - 'Lora' for all body text (p, li, etc.).
   - **Color Palette:**
     - Page Background: `#f5f1e8` (a soft, papyrus-like white).
     - Text Color: `#3a3a3a` (dark charcoal, not pure black).
     - Primary/Accent Color: `#c89c5b` (an antique gold for headings, links, and borders).
     - Stone/Card Background: `#e0dace` (a light stone color).
   - **Background Texture:** Apply a subtle, seamless parchment texture to the `body` background. You can use a placeholder URL for now if needed.
   - **Responsiveness:** The website must be fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layouts.
   - **Overall Feel:** All elements should have a clean, spacious layout. Avoid sharp corners; use a slight `border-radius` on card elements.

**2. HTML Structure (`index.html`):**

Create the following sections in order, using semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`):

   - **Header & Navbar:**
     - A simple, sticky navbar at the top.
     - Include the name (e.g., "Your Name") on the left.
     - Navigation links on the right: "About", "Skills", "Projects", "Experience", "Contact".
     - The links should scroll smoothly to the corresponding sections using JavaScript.

   - **Hero Section (`<section id="hero">`):**
     - Full-screen section.
     - A large main heading (H1) with the text: "Architect of Digital Realms".
     - A sub-heading (H2) below it: "DevOps & Cloud Engineer".

   - **About Section (`<section id="about">`):**
     - A heading (H2): "The Chronicle".
     - A two-column layout. Left column for a short bio/paragraph (use placeholder text). Right column for a circular placeholder image.

   - **Skills Section (`<section id="skills">`):**
     - A heading (H2): "The Armory".
     - Use a CSS Grid to display skills in card-like elements.
     - Each card should have a light stone background color (`#e0dace`) and a gold border.
     - Create cards for skills like: AWS, Azure, GCP, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Python, and Bash.

   - **Projects Section (`<section id="projects">`):**
     - A heading (H2): "Great Constructions".
     - Use a CSS Grid to display 2-3 project cards.
     - Each project card should contain:
       - Project Title (H3).
       - A short description paragraph.
       - A list of technologies used.
       - Two buttons: "View Blueprint" (for GitHub) and "See Live" (for a demo link). Style the buttons with the gold accent color.

   - **Experience Section (`<section id="experience">`):**
     - A heading (H2): "The Scroll of Experience".
     - Design this as a vertical timeline.
     - Each point on the timeline should represent a job role with:
       - Job Title & Company Name.
       - Dates (e.g., "2022 - Present").
       - A short list of responsibilities.
     - Use CSS to create the central timeline line and the circular points.

   - **Contact Section (`<section id="contact">`):**
     - A heading (H2): "Send a Messenger".
     - A simple contact form with fields for "Name", "Email", and "Message".
     - A submit button with the text "Send Message".
     - Below the form, include icons (placeholder icons are fine) for LinkedIn and GitHub.

   - **Footer (`<footer>`):**
     - A simple, clean footer with "Â© [Current Year] Your Name. Crafted with code."

**3. JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`):**
   - Implement smooth scrolling for the navigation links. When a link in the navbar is clicked, the page should smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.
   - (Optional) Add a subtle fade-in effect for sections as the user scrolls down the page.

Please generate the code for all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) based on these detailed instructions. Add comments in the code where necessary to explain the structure.
